Throughout my life I've seen a lot of people, fictional as well as real.
And my first impression after seeing some of them are, "he's literally me".

From meth-cooking chemistry teachers to The Dark Knight,
this questionable list shows people as well was somewhat questionable people whom I can see myself within.
Get ready not to question my sanity as we dive into the list of people who are "literally me."

    # Satou Kazuma

    Why is he literally me? well first of all he's able to make good decisions at the right time when it counts
    and the other reason is, he advocates for true gender equality,
    even if it means dropkicking a rotten woman who deserves it.

    Overall, a very rational dude

After watching Breaking Bad, I think I finally found a good use for my chemistry knowledge
but after witnessing how it ended, I don't think I'm buit for that industry...yet

But anyway, he found out that he was going to die in about 2 years and decided to ball,
that sounds like something I would do

Carefree attitude with witty remarks? \
sounds like me \
Also was an exectative at the mafia? \
Bro is living the dream \
And also has a particular mindset which I won't talk about here...if you know, you know

One day...one day....

The first actual person in this list

The reason for being "literally me"? \
Having unparalleled chess skills as well as a tendency for trolling opponents? \
that sounds like me

# Iron Man

Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is the epitome of "literally me" if I had money, \
"let's say you had money, but you don't have the suit" \
Not an issue, I can figure something out, that's what the money is for

And walking facing the camera with a big explosion behind is something that I'd do

# Nikola Jokić

How is he "literally me" you ask? \
From the way that he plays to the way that he talks... \
I could keep yapping about the details for an hour

And him going from a second round draft pick to winning 3 MVP's \
that literally sounds like my comeback arc

One day...one day...

# Senku Ishigami

Building a scientific civilization while still in the Stone Age is something I dream about every night \
The simpler version of this is, 'How would I survive if I were trapped on an uninhabited island alone?' \
the answer to that question being, I wouldn't eat, sleep and hunt all day... \
Nope, I'll probably try to find a way to automate it (using technology of course) \
And also I probably won't last long without a laptop, so I'd probably try to make one of those

But because of him, now I have the tendency to DIY stuff or try making stuff from scratch \
even though there's no problem at all with not making stuff from scratch and building on other discoveries

# Batman

Don't even get me started... \
Fighting villains at night, not for recognition or fame, but to bring justice \
my version of this would be rotting away coding at night \
working on a pretty cool project that no one cares about, \
simply because I do it for the love of the game, not for clout \
If only my projects had the slightest bit of Silicon Valley type of marketing or hype, \
I bet they would bring in millions of dollars from random investors
who want to chip in on the next big thing

And don't hit me with the 'bUt I've sEeN a LOt OF iNDie devs On twiTtEr wHo earN A LoT FroM ThEiR prOJeCTS' \
well... half of them are cringe, a quarter of them are salespeople pretending to be indie devs, \
oh, and an eighth of them are bots \
'Why don't you get a job then?' \
I'm a student with not a lot of time to work a job, let alone all of these side projects

And with that being said, that is why I literally am Batman \
and I should probably fix my sleep schedule
